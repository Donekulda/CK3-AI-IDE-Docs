# Crusader Kings 3 Mod File Structure

## Understanding CK3 Game Mechanics and Modding Workflow

Crusader Kings 3 (CK3) is built on a highly modular and data-driven architecture, making it extremely mod-friendly. The game's mechanics are defined by a combination of plaintext configuration files, scripts, and assets, all organized into a clear directory structure. Here's a detailed look at how the system works and how you can leverage it for modding:

### 1. File and Folder Structure

CK3 organizes its game logic, assets, and data into specific folders, each with a dedicated purpose. This modular approach allows modders to override, extend, or add new content without directly modifying the base game files.

- **common/**: Contains core game rules, definitions, and mechanics. Each subfolder here represents a different system (e.g., governments, laws, traits, scripted effects).
- **events/**: Houses all event definitions and event chains. Events are written in plaintext and can be triggered by in-game actions, conditions, or scripts.
- **gfx/**: Stores all graphical assets, such as textures, icons, models, and portraits.
- **gui/**: Contains user interface definitions, including window layouts, HUD elements, and custom widgets.
- **history/**: Holds historical data, such as character genealogies, province histories, and title lineages.
- **localization/**: Contains all in-game text, organized by language for easy translation and customization.

### 2. File Naming and Load Order

- **Unique Naming**: To prevent conflicts, all files should have unique names, typically using a short prefix (2â€“5 letters) related to your mod, followed by a number for load order, and a descriptive name.
- **Load Order**: Files are loaded in alphabetical order. Lower numbers load first, so use numbering to control which files override others if necessary.

### 3. Scripting and Game Logic

CK3 uses a custom scripting language for defining game logic, triggers, and effects. These scripts are stored in `.txt` files within the appropriate subfolders (e.g., `scripted_effects/`, `scripted_triggers/`). This allows for:
- **Custom Triggers**: Boolean conditions that determine if certain actions or events can occur.
- **Scripted Effects**: Custom functions that execute when triggered by events, decisions, or other game systems.
- **Dynamic Values**: Use of `script_values/` to define values that can change based on game state.

### 4. Events System

Events are a core part of CK3's storytelling and gameplay. Each event is defined with a unique ID, type, title, description, triggers, and options. Events can:
- Affect characters, realms, or the world.
- Be triggered by player actions, AI decisions, or scripted conditions.
- Include custom GUI widgets, portraits, and dynamic content.

### 5. Visual and UI Customization

- **gfx/**: Add or override visual assets such as icons, backgrounds, and models.
- **gui/**: Modify or create new interface elements, windows, and widgets to enhance user experience or support new mechanics.

### 6. Localization

All in-game text is stored in the `localization/` directory, organized by language. This allows for easy translation and ensures your mod is accessible to a wider audience.

### 7. Modding Workflow

1. **Plan Your Changes**: Decide which systems you want to modify or extend.
2. **Create Unique Files**: Use unique prefixes and numbers for all new files.
3. **Organize Content**: Place files in the correct directories based on their function.
4. **Script and Define**: Write or modify scripts, triggers, and effects as needed.
5. **Add Events and Assets**: Create new events, add graphical assets, and update the UI as required.
6. **Localize**: Add or update localization files for all supported languages.
7. **Test Thoroughly**: Load your mod in-game and test all changes to ensure compatibility and stability.

### 8. Example: Adding a New Trait

Suppose you want to add a new character trait:
- Create a new file in `common/traits/` (e.g., `MYMOD_01_new_trait.txt`).
- Define the trait's properties, triggers, and effects.
- Add an icon to `gfx/interface/traits/`.
- Update localization files with the trait's name and description.
- (Optional) Script events or decisions that interact with the new trait.

---

This structure allows for modular, organized, and powerful modding of CK3, letting you change or expand nearly every aspect of the game.

This document describes the folder and file structure for CK3 modding, including what each folder should contain and how files should be named.

File names should be fully unique, as if they are same as either other mod or main game (Code folder), then it will overwrite it, as the load order states what overwrites what (the latter ones overwrite the foremost ones).
as such they should made from PREFIX - which should be between 2-5 letters long, and should be in some way unique to the mod (for example made up of first letters of each word of the mods name)
and NUMBER which is easiest way to state what load first as, the lower number is sorted sooner, for this reason the file name should look like
PREFIX_NUMBER_some_name_folder_name.txt -> example: WW_00_forge_staff_desicion.txt

Now for the folder structure and what each folder should contain

}

=== Custom Widgets ===

Custom widgets can be embedded into events.
GUI files must be placed at the event_window_widgets path (see paths.settings). The name of the file must match the widget name.

Some widgets that modify the game require a custom controller. This should be documented in the widget's GUI file.
The data context type available in the GUI depends on the controller type.

Some controllers require special scope setup, which should be documented under Notes below. Use the setup_scope effect for that.

Available controllers:

Controller Type         | Data Context Name                      | Notes
------------------------+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
default                 | EventWindowWidget                      | Default controller, no special behavior
name_character          | EventWindowWidgetNameCharacter         | Changes a character's name. Scope must have the name_character_target saved scope.
text                    | EventWindowWidgetEnterText             | Saves some text onto the character.
event_chain_progress    | EventWindowWidgetChainProgress         | Displays progress through an event chain, needs event_chain_length and event_chain_progress scope values set
struggle_info           | EventWindowCustomWidgetStruggleInfo    | Displays information for the struggle, needs "start" scope value set
